# Groovebox

A digital musical instrument/generative music research project done in WPI's Music Perception and Robotics Laboratory. 

This project uses Google Magneta's GrooVAE network to generate music from a sequence of hand-drum hits.

### TODO
- [ ] Have it so that loop swaps happen on the first beat of a measure
- [ ] Extend to support more tempos
